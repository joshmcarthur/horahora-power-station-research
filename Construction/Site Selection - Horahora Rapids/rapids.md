The Horahora Rapids at the time were one of just a few spots along the Waikato River where the river ran shallow and narrow enough for rapids to form. Prior to the construction of the station, the rapids ran in two forks around a island in the middle of the river - a small channel flowing directly past the island, with the main channel flowing around in a 600-meter loop before rejoining it's normal course just above the old bridge. Since the lake was formed, the location of the rapids is now a moderately sized basin next to Finlay Park, used mostly as a turnaround spot by local boaties (as it is located just prior to a 5-knot speed limit upriver).

The construction of the power station diverted the majority of the rapids through the more direct channel, which operated on demand as a spillway. The channel for the station intake itself was cut into the river bank, beginning just above the rapids, and discharging approximately 500 meters further down the river.
