For it's time, Horahora Power Station was planned to have enough capacity to provide power not only to the Waihi Mining Company, but also to retail customers in the future. This was early days for electricity generation however, and demand exceeded available supply in just 15 years.

The station originally generated 6.3 megawatts using six turbines imported from England. At the time that construction was completed, this made the station the largest in the country. By the mid-1920s, and after the station was acquired by the government, it was clear that more generation capacity was required, so two modern (for the time) turbines were added, increasing maximum output to 10.3 megawatts and enabling the supply area for the station to be extended to the Bay of Plenty and Auckland (although Auckland historically had it's own generation facility at Kings Wharf in Auckland).

Compared to today, the power generated by Horahora was insignificant - the current largest power station in New Zealand, Manapouri, has a maximum capcity more than 80 times higher. At the time however, the station was considered at the cutting edge, and was probably capable of powering the entire North Island had lines infrastructure existed.
