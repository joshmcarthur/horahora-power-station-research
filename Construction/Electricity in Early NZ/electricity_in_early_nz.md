Electricity in New Zealand started mostly with the main centers around the end of the 19th century, being largely limited to usage for street lighting and public transport (trams). The power source for this electricity was limited to local generation, there being no centralized power grid to distribute power - typically, cities and towns would generate electricity using steam or coal generation. During the first decade of the 20th century, there was increasing demand for power generation to operate at greater scales to serve larger and larger areas. The government preferred a few large stations to supply the country, in the North Island considering Lake Waikaremoana in the East Central region and the Waikato River to be likely areas, but proceeded with caution and did not develop facilities for several years. In the meantime, industries were modernizing and were increasingly dependent on expensive fuel sources such as coal and steam with which to generate electricity a few power stations, such as Horahora, were eventually constructed, usually funded by one or more companies, but with provisions to supply some amount of production capacity to local power boards for distribution to towns and smaller companies who could not afford such extravagant measures. Soon after, electricity began to be available in homes, and demand quickly grew. Over the following decades, as generation techology improved and became more affordable, electricity changed from being a rare commodity, often only available for a few hours per day, to a ubiquituous resource used by all.
