The Horahora Power Station was one of the pioneering electricity generation facilities in New Zealand. It was created originally to produce power for mining, eventually scaling and diversifying to provide power for much of the North Island of New Zealand. This application takes you through the history of this iconic station, right from the pioneering early days of electrical power, right through to the moment the waters of the newly-created Lake Karapiro rose and covered the power station, leaving a still surface that remains today, with most people unaware that anything at all used to exist there.
