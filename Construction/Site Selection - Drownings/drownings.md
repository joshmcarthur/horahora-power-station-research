Before the construction of the station, the nearby Pokaiwhenua Stream was a popular spot for swimming during the summer months, but remained dangerous - despite the calm lake at the river mouth today, at the time the river emerged at the head of the fast-flowing Horahora Rapids. The Waikato Times of the 15<sup>th</sup> January 1884 documents a sad case in which a child was swept away as her mother swam in the stream - in the strong current, and faced with the rapids, her body was never recovered. These days, the stream is not popular for swimming, as it has become overgrown with reed beds along the shore, and submerged hazards around the road bridge.
