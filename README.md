This repository contains content being written to document the history of the former Horahora Power Station, 1913-1947, located in the South Waikato district of the North Island of New Zealand and now submerged beneath the waters of Lake Karapiro, the reservoir for the Karapiro Dam which completed construction in 1947.

Content in this repository is in a draft form, and may be incomplete or incorrect. It will eventually be used to present a small personal interactive site to help others understand the depths of history that surround us - whether we are aware of the history, or not.
